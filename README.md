### Question(s)

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules:**

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example 1:

![](Q1.png)

Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]  
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]  
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]  
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]  
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]  
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]  
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]  
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]  
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]  
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]  
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]  
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]  
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]  
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]  
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]  
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]  
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]  
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]  
Output: false  
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

**Constraints**

board.length == 9  
board[i].length == 9  
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'
